 * Handles Accept and Reject pressed on the new-order notification.

 * Silencing and clearing the alert happens HERE, synchronously, before anything that
 * can be slow or fail. The restaurant pressed a button; the ringing has to stop that
 * instant, whether or not the network call that follows succeeds.
 *
 * The status update itself is carried out by Dart, which already owns the auth token
 * and the API client. [PendingOrderAction] hands the decision over immediately when
 * the app's engine is alive, and parks it otherwise.
