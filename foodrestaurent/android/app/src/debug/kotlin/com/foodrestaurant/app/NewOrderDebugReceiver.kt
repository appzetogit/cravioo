/**
 * DEBUG ONLY. Drives the new-order alert from adb, without involving FCM.
 *
 * Lives in src/debug so it is not compiled into release at all — not merely disabled
 * there, absent.
 *
 * Exercising the alert through a real push means depending on push delivery, Doze,
 * per-OEM background limits and which device currently holds the account's FCM token.
 * None of those are the alert's behaviour, and every one of them fails in a way that
 * looks identical to the alert being broken, which makes it nearly impossible to test
 * in isolation. Driving the Accept/Reject actions from here is likewise the only way
 * to test them deterministically: hunting for the buttons in the notification shade
 * depends on whether the heads-up is still expanded, which it usually is not.
 *
